# Questions about the class.
### -Explain why a developer, who is good at both low-level and high-level programming languages, would normally use a high-level language when writing programs?
##### °It is good for a developer to be able to program at both low and high levels, because this allows him to have a greater area of knowledge, with respect to his competence, that allows the developer to be able to perform different functions in both a professional and work environment, since he can be in charge of supervising projects that require a low level of programming and can develop even more skills in the low levels.
### -What is machine code?
##### °Machine code is a strictly numerical language which is intended to run as fast as possible, and it may be regarded as the lowest-level representation of a compiled or assembled computer program or as a primitive and hardware-dependent programming language.
### Give an example of a high-level language?
##### °Some examples would be of high-level programming languages in active use today include Python, Visual Basic, Delphi, Perl, PHP, ECMAScript, Ruby, C#, Java and many others. The terms high-level and low-level are inherently relative.
### Describethree differences between low-level language and high-level languages? 
High-Level Language | Low-level language
---                                 | ---
It can be considered as a programmer-friendly language.|It is considered as a machine-friendly language.|
It requires a compiler/interpreter to be translated into machine code.|It requires an assembler that would translate instructions.
It can be ported from one location to another.|It is not portable.
It is easy to understand.|It is difficult to understand.
It is easy to debug.|It is difficult to debug
It is less memory efficient, i.e., it consumes more memory in comparison to low-level languages|It consumes less memory.

### -What does a translator do? 
##### °A translator is a programming language processor that converts a computer program from one language to another. It takes a program written in source code and converts it into machine code. It discovers and identifies the error during translation.
### -Identify two types of translators that can turn high-level languages into machine code?

#### -Interpreter
##### °An interpreter translates code like a compiler but reads the code and immediately executes on that code, and therefore is initially faster than a compiler,thus, interpreters are often used in software development tools as debugging tools, as they can execute a single in of code at a time. 
#### -Compiler
##### °Acompiler creates machine code that runs on a processor with a specific Instruction Set Architecture (ISA), which is processor-dependent.
### -What is the difference between an interpreter and a compiler?
Differences between Interpreter and Compiler 
-    
 Interpreter  | Compiler
 ---                | ---
 Interpreter translates just one statement of the program at a time into machine code.|Compiler scans the entire program and translates the whole of it into machine code at once.
 An interpreter takes very less time to analyze the source code. However, the overall time to execute the process is much slower.|A compiler takes a lot of time to analyze the source code. However, the overall time taken to execute the process is much faster.
 An interpreter does not generate an intermediary code. Hence, an interpreter is highly efficient in terms of its memory.|A compiler always generates an intermediary object code. It will need further linking. Hence more memory is needed.
 Keeps translating the program continuously till the first error is confronted. If any error is spotted, it stops working and hence debugging becomes easy.|A compiler generates the error message only after it scans the complete program and hence debugging is relatively harder while working with a compiler.
 Interpreters are used by programming languages like Ruby and Python for example.|Compliers are used by programming languages like C and C++ for example.
 
 ### -What is assembly language?
 ##### ° In computer programming, assembly language (or assembler language), often abbreviated asm, is any low-level programming language in which there is a very strong correspondence between the instructions in the language and the architecture's machine code instructions.
 ### -A developer is writing a program
 #### a) The program is written in a high-level language and it is then translated into machine code. Describe two differences between high-level language and machine code?
 ##### -While the high level can be used in more complex systems, in a machine language or low level it is only used in a specific way, likewise, it only translates into 0 and 1, and in a high level, we have more specialized commands in specific uses that the programmer has access to.
 #### b) One type of translator is an interpreter.
 ### 1) Describe how an interpreter translates high-level language programs into machine code?
 ##### °An interpreter translates code into machine code, instruction by instruction - the CPU executes each instruction before the interpreter moves on to translate the next instruction. Interpreted code will show an error as soon as it hits a problem, so it is easier to debug than compiled code, an interpreter does not create an independent final set of source code - source code is created each time it runs. Interpreted code is slower to execute than compiled code.
 ### 2) State the name of a different type of translator that can be used to translate high-level code into machine code?
 ##### °A processor for a programming language is a system capable of manipulating programs written in that language in order to execute it or prepare it for execution. This definition is very general and contains different systems that manipulate programs: of course compilers and interpreters of programming languages.
