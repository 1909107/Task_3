# The representation of the control structures.
###### -It is a way to specify the control in programs, there are three basic types of logic,or controlflow, known as sequence logic, or sequencial flow or selection logic or conditional flow.
### - If- else.
##### The if - else  control structure allows a program to execute some instructions when a condition is met and other instructions when the condition is not met. allows a program to execute some instructions when a condition is met and other instructions when the condition is not met. In English "if" means "if" (condition) and "else" means "if not".
### -Switch.
##### A Switch conditionals are a conditional control structure that allows you to define multiple cases that can be fulfilled by any variable, and what action to take in any of these situations, it is even possible to determine what action to take in case of not fulfilling any of the conditions.
### - Cycles.
##### -The "PE Cycles" or "Program-Erase Cycles" can serve as a yardstick for the lifetime of the solid-state storage unit. All-flash memory based devices are capable of a limited number of PE Cycles because each cycle causes a specific amount of physical damage to the media.
### - Do-while.
##### -The do-while structure is another repetitive structure, which executes at least once its repetitive block, unlike the while or for which may not execute the block. This repetitive structure is used when we know in advance that the repetitive block will be executed at least once.
### -While.
##### -is a repetitive control structure that can prevent the execution of an instruction set if the evaluation of the relational and/or logical expression is false. This means that it becomes repetitive only when the evaluation of the condition is true.
### -For.
##### -is a third repetitive control structure, its main characteristic lies in the fact that within itself, it contains the initialization of variables, as well as the increment/decrement variables necessary in a cycle.
### -In my own words, what are the differences between if-else switch and do-while and while and for.
|If-else  |Switch  |
|--|--|
| If-else statement can evaluate almost all types of data such as interger, floating point, character, pointer or booleap. |Switch statement can evaluate either or a characters more spesifics.  |
#
|DO-while| While  | For  |
|--|--|--|
| This is exit control lopp, checks conditions when coming out fron lop. | This is entry controlled loop, it checks conditions before entering into loop.  | Typically we will use the for when we want to run through all possible cases|
